account.its a free year long, renewable every year and uses your .edu.
Basically, the paid version has more gui commands to make certain things easier
but, if you dont want to use it, you should be able to do everything via command line

#tutorials

##Python
Allen Downey's *Think Python* is a great intro to programming and the Python language.
Working through it over a weekend is a great away to get acquainted with the language
and its built-in data structures. It starts with telling you how to install the Python3,
if you needed that information.

Another useful tutorial is *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*, which teaches beginners
to the language all sorts of useful things. Check out the Table of Contents.

MOOC sites like Coursera, edx, and Udacity all have great Python courses.
Udacity in particular has a bunch of self-paced courses in Python at all levels. 
Working through *Think Python* followed by one of Udacity's introductory Python courses
will really cement the language in your mind.

##Django
Here is a solid tutorial on Python/Django
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/

Here is the actual python download, it contains all the links for different OS's there
We're going for python 3.5.2 unless any one wants to do something different.
